## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, CocktailDB Api

Site utilizes CSS variables for the color theming, flexbox and a carousel slider effect made via Javascript. Responsive website also utilizes css media queries to adapt to varying devices.
Also uses icons from fontAwesome. 

## Optimizations

DrinkLib could be improved in terms of layout scaling, in my opinion the scale is too large for usage, and the design and ui could be refactored to allow for easier viewing without a scroll.
Also, refactoring the code base to be cleaner, more effiecient, perhaps utilizing OOP principals to abstract more details would be a good optimization for this project. 

## Lessons Learned:

There was a lot of complications that came up in creating the slider. Preplanning the logic would have been a more efficient way of working on this. 
This was a great time for me to work with CSS variables, and I gained more experience with them on this project, as well as with complexities that arose during API calls.
