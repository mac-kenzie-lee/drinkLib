## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, CocktailDB API

Site utilizes CSS variables for the color theme, flexbox, and a carousel slider effect made via Javascript. Responsive website also utilizes css media queries to adapt to varying devices.
Also uses icons from fontAwesome. 

## Future Improvements To Consider

DrinkLib could be improved in terms of layout scaling, in my opinion, the scale is too large for usage, and the design and ui could be refactored to allow for easier viewing without a scroll.
Also, refactoring the code base to be cleaner, and more efficient, perhaps utilizing OOP principles to abstract more details would be a good optimization for this project. 

## Lessons Learned:

There were a lot of complications that came up in creating the slider. Preplanning the logic would have been a more efficient way of working on this. 
This was a great time for me to work with CSS variables, and I gained more experience with them on this project, as well as with complexities that arose during API calls.
